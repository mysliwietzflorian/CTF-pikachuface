# Pikachuface CTF

Find the solution of the puzzle. All parts of the solution word can be found in
the file `00_specification/pikachuface.svg.zst`. A decompressed version of that
file can be found at `00_specification/pikachuface.svg`.

Hint: The solution starts with `CSR{` and ends with `}`.

Good luck.

## Notes before starting the solution script

As the remote repository does not allow files bigger than 100 MB in size, two
files had to be removed from the repo:

- `00_specification/pikachuface.svg` (can be decompressed from *.svg.zst)
- `cache/01_all_query_entries.txt` (can be either generated - takes
  approximately 12 minutes - or just created as an empty file as duplicate lines
  will be removed in the subsequent step and loaded from a cache file)
